            <p>I&apos;m a software developer with a growing passion for building accessible, intuitive, and
                performance-driven
                websites.
                My journey into tech has been shaped by curiosity, self-learning, and the joy of seeing ideas come to
                life in
                the browser.
                I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and create work that has real-world impact.
